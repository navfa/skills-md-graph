# skill-graph

A CLI tool that turns plain Markdown files into a navigable dependency graph. Write your skills as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter, and `skill-graph` will parse them, detect issues, and let you query the relationships between them.

## What it does

You write files like this:

```markdown
---
name: error-handling
description: Master Rust error handling patterns
dependencies:
  - rust-basics
---

## Description

This skill covers Result, Option, and the ? operator.
```

Then `skill-graph` can:

- **Scan** a directory and parse all skill files
- **Build** a dependency graph and render it as DOT/PNG
- **Lint** for problems: cycles, orphans, missing dependencies
- **Query** the graph: who depends on what, shortest paths
- **Export** to RDF/Turtle or Cypher for Neo4j

## Getting started

```sh
cargo install skills-md-graph
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/navfa/skills-md-graph.git
cd skills-md-graph
make build
```

## Usage

```sh
# Scan and list all skills
skill-graph scan ./skills

# Get JSON output
skill-graph scan ./skills --json

# Async scan with progress bar (useful for large vaults)
skill-graph scan ./skills --progress --workers 8

# Generate a dependency graph
skill-graph graph ./skills
skill-graph graph ./skills --png graph.png --stats

# Lint for issues (returns exit code 1 if errors found, great for CI)
skill-graph lint ./skills

# Query the graph
skill-graph query ./skills --uses rust-basics        # who depends on this?
skill-graph query ./skills --deps error-handling      # transitive dependencies
skill-graph query ./skills --path-between error-handling,rust-basics

# Export for external tools
skill-graph export ./skills --format rdf
skill-graph export ./skills --format cypher
```

## Configuration

Configuration is **optional**. Everything works out of the box with sensible defaults (only `name` is required in frontmatter, all other fields are optional).

If you want to customize behavior, drop a `.skill-graph.toml` anywhere in your project tree. The CLI walks up parent directories to find it, just like `.gitignore`. You can also pass one explicitly with `--config path/to/config.toml`.

```toml
[schema]
# Only "name" is required by default. Add more if you want stricter validation.
required_fields = ["name"]
optional_fields = ["description", "dependencies", "inputs", "outputs"]

# Define shortcuts for frontmatter fields.
# With this config, you can write "deps:" instead of "dependencies:" in your files.
[schema.aliases]
deps = "dependencies"
desc = "description"

[scan]
# Number of parallel workers for async scan (default: number of CPUs)
workers = 8
# File extensions to scan (default: ["md"])
extensions = ["md"]
```

### Minimal skill file

Only `name` is required. Everything else is optional:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
---

Content goes here.
```

## Benchmark

On a dataset of 10,000 generated skill files:

| Mode | Time | Speedup |
|---|---|---|
| Sync | ~410ms | baseline |
| Async (4 workers) | ~357ms | 1.15x |
| Async (8 workers) | ~270ms | 1.52x |

Run `make bench` to reproduce on your machine.

## VSCode Extension

A lightweight VSCode extension lives in `vscode-extension/`. It spawns the CLI under the hood and gives you:

- **Hover** — see a skill's description by hovering over its name in a dependency list
- **Go-to-definition** — jump to the skill file from a dependency reference
- **Diagnostics** — warnings for dependencies that don't match any known skill

## Development

```sh
make check    # fmt + clippy + test in one shot
make test     # run all tests
make bench    # run the 10k file benchmark
make lint     # cargo clippy
```
